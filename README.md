# Motion Graphics Project: *The Future Begins with a Page*

## About the Project:
This motion graphics video was created to inspire children to embrace the love of reading. It highlights the transformative power of books through the journey of a child who discovers the magic hidden within a library. The video emphasizes how reading shapes brighter futures.

## Graduation Project:
This project was proudly developed as part of our graduation from the **Digital Egypt Builders Initiative (DEBI)**, under the auspices of the **Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of Egypt**. 
Participating in this initiative was a great honor, and it allowed me to collaborate with talented colleagues to bring this vision to life.
